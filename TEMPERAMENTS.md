# Temperaments & commas

This file collects quick reference notes about **comma temperaments** (regular temperaments defined by “tempering out” one or more commas).

For the underlying Kyrandia 1 audio-bank reverse-engineering context, see [MUSIC.md](MUSIC.md).

## Commas (common small intervals)

A **comma** is a small frequency ratio close to unison that arises when you compare two different ways of building “the same” interval.

Useful commas (ratio → cents):

- **Syntonic comma**: $81/80 \approx 21.506\,$c
  - Difference between a just major third $5/4$ and four pure fifths minus two octaves: $(3/2)^4 / 2^2 = 81/64$.
  - This is the comma targeted by the **meantone** family.
- **Pythagorean comma**: $3^{12} / 2^{19} = 531441/524288 \approx 23.460\,$c
  - Mismatch between stacking 12 pure fifths and returning by octaves.
  - Any temperament that closes the circle of fifths (including 12‑TET) necessarily “does something” with this comma.
- **Schisma**: $32805/32768 \approx 1.953\,$c
  - A very small comma appearing when comparing 5-limit and 3-limit constructions; important in high-accuracy tempering schemes.
- **Diaschisma**: $2048/2025 \approx 19.553\,$c
  - Related to 5-limit accounting; sometimes used as a target comma in modern regular temperament discussions.
- **Lesser diesis**: $128/125 \approx 41.059\,$c
  - A larger “comma-like” interval that appears in 5-limit contexts.
- **Kleisma**: $15625/15552 \approx 8.107\,$c
  - A small comma that shows up in some higher-limit regular temperament discussions (including “miracle”-adjacent ones).

7-limit examples:

- **Septimal comma**: $64/63 \approx 27.264\,$c
- **Septimal diesis**: $49/48 \approx 35.697\,$c

## What “comma temperament” means (practical)

A **regular temperament** picks one or more commas and maps them to unison (or distributes them across a generator such as the fifth).

That has two practical consequences:

- Enharmonic spellings that are distinct in pure JI (e.g., $G\sharp$ vs $A\flat$) can become the *same pitch* (or much closer) in the temperament.
- Some intervals become “especially good” approximations of their just ratios (e.g., meantone makes some major thirds very close to $5/4$).

## Widely discussed comma-based temperaments

This is not exhaustive, but covers the ones you most often see referenced.

### Meantone family (targets the syntonic comma $81/80$)

Meantone temperaments temper the syntonic comma by narrowing each fifth by some fraction of it.

- **1/4‑comma meantone**: each fifth is narrowed by $(81/80)^{1/4}$.
  - Famous for very pure major thirds (at the cost of a “wolf” interval elsewhere).
- **1/5‑comma, 1/6‑comma, 1/7‑comma meantone**:
  - Progressively closer to 12‑TET, with different compromises (less extreme wolfiness, thirds less pure).

### Equal temperaments (distribute closure error evenly)

- **12‑TET**: closes the fifth-cycle by making each fifth slightly narrow, i.e. it spreads the Pythagorean comma across 12 steps.
- Other EDO/ET systems (e.g., 19‑ET, 31‑ET, 53‑ET) can be understood as different systematic ways of approximating just ratios (and therefore different ways of “handling” commas).

### “Well temperaments” (historical, uneven distribution)

Many historical keyboard temperaments (often called “well temperaments”) are not defined by a single tempered-out comma, but by **unevenly distributing** the needed adjustments so all keys are usable but have different “color”.

Examples (names you may see): Werckmeister, Kirnberger, Vallotti/Young, etc.

### Schismatic / “miracle”-adjacent / higher-limit regular temperaments

In modern regular temperament theory (especially beyond 5-limit), you’ll often see temperaments described by which small commas they temper out.

- **Schismatic** temperaments: temper out (or nearly temper out) the **schisma** ($32805/32768$), causing some very close JI spellings to collapse.
- **“Miracle”-adjacent** discussions often involve tempering out very small commas (on the order of single-digit cents), such as the **kleisma** ($15625/15552$) and related commas in 7-limit contexts.

This category is broad: unlike the meantone family (which is tightly organized around $81/80$), higher-limit temperaments are often best identified by their specific comma targets and the resulting set of good interval approximations.

## Temperament comparison table (note frequencies)

You asked for **temperaments horizontally** and **notes vertically**, with the intersections being **frequencies**.

Conventions used here:

- Anchor pitch: **A4 = 440 Hz** for every temperament.
- Notes shown: a fixed 12-note spelling set: **C, C#, D, Eb, E, F, F#, G, Ab, A, Bb, B** (in octave 4).
  - In temperaments where enharmonics differ (especially meantone), this spelling choice matters (e.g. Eb is not the same as D#).
- For equal temperaments (12/19/31/53-ET) and the “generated by fifths” rows (Pythagorean + meantone), note spellings are assigned via the circle-of-fifths chain relative to A.
- The **Werckmeister III** column is a concrete well temperament: the one Wikipedia labels **Werckmeister I (III)** (commonly called “Werckmeister III” in modern usage).
